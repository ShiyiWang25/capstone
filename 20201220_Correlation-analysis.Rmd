#### Subject: 
Transcriptome data of 41 breast tumors with available three-dimensional tumor diameters

#### Object: 
To reveal the genes significantly correlated with SED

#### Filter criteria:
1. p-Value < 0.01

2. means > 10

3. CV > 1

#### Note:
This is the reproduction of the results in the paper.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

# import data
data <- read_csv("data/SED_vs_Transcriptome-Profile/Correlation_and_CV.csv") %>%
  print()
```

```{r}
# filter the data using the filter criteria:
data_filtered <- data %>%
  filter(pvalue <0.01) %>%
  filter(Means > 10) %>%
  filter(CV > 1) %>%
  print()
```
```{r}
# How many genes significantly correlated with SED?
# (i.e., How many genes pass the filter?)
dim(data_filtered)
```

```{r}
# sort the data ascendingly by the "correlation" value
data_sorted <- data_filtered %>%
  arrange(correlation) %>%
  print()
```

```{r}
# How many genes show significant negative correlation with SED?
# (i.e., How many genes have a correlation value < 0?)
data_sorted %>%
  filter(correlation < 0) %>%
  nrow() %>%
  print()
```


```{r}
# How many genes show significant poistive correlation with SED?
# (i.e., How many genes have a correlation value > 0?)
data_sorted %>%
  filter(correlation > 0) %>%
  nrow() %>%
  print()
```
